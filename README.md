1. Queue Project - It is a simple project to practice C++ and some new data structures and algorithms such as priority queue, minheap, maxheap etc.

It basically use heapify algorithm ( min heap ) to figure out which of given point is closest to start point and set priority in priority queue. Later added some basic function which is calculating convex polygon area of given points using schoelace formula and sorting verticies by centroid.



2. Sorting Algorithms - Just compares execution time ( while sorting obviously ) of few most popular sorting algorithms using chrono library.
